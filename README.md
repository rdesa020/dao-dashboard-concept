This project is a self-initiated dashboard concept inspired by decentralized governance platforms. I built it independently during an interview process to showcase my ability to design and develop interactive front-end systems with clean data visualizations and an AI-assisted experience.

The dashboard includes modules for Treasury Analytics, Proposal Management, and an AI Assistant that helps users analyze DAO performance and governance activity.

Built with: React (.tsx), JSON, CSS Modules, and React-ChartJS.

Even though it started as an interview demo, it became a meaningful prototype that reflects my initiative, product thinking, and focus on user-centered dashboard design.
